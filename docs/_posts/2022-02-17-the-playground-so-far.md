So far we worked on a bunch of scripts to play with technologies relevant for S-ENDA

In [catalog][catalog] you find some sample scripts to play with ogc(mostly csw) and xsdata.

In [collection][collection] there is a set of Postman collections to interact with csw services.

In [hello-xarray][hello] there are some samples to work with xarray and trying to follow cf-convention.
