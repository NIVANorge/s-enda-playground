    """Abstract parameter value or group of parameter values.

    This abstract complexType is expected to be extended and restricted
    for well-known operation methods with many instances, in Application
    Schemas that define operation-method-specialized element names and
    contents. Specific parameter value elements are directly contained
    in concrete subtypes, not in this abstract type. All concrete types
    derived from this type shall extend this type to include one
    "...Value" element with an appropriate type, which should be one of
    the element types allowed in the ParameterValueType. In addition,
    all derived concrete types shall extend this type to include a
    "valueOfParameter" element that references one element substitutable
    for the "OperationParameter" element.
