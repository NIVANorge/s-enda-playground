    """Direction of this coordinate system axis (or in the case of Cartesian
    projected coordinates, the direction of this coordinate system axis at the
    origin).

    Examples: north or south, east or west, up or down. Within any set of coordinate system axes, only one of each pair of terms can be used. For earth-fixed CRSs, this direction is often approximate and intended to provide a human interpretable meaning to the axis. When a geodetic datum is used, the precise directions of the axes may therefore vary slightly from this approximate direction. Note that an EngineeringCRS can include specific descriptions of the directions of its coordinate system axes. For example, the path of a linear CRS axis can be referenced in another document, such as referencing a GML feature that references or includes a curve geometry. The codeSpace attribute can reference a source of more information on a set of standardized directions, or on this direction.
