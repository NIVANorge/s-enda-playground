    This time may be precise (e.g. 1997.0 for IRTF97) or merely a year
    (e.g. 1983 for NAD83). In the latter case, the epoch usually refers
    to the year in which a major recalculation of the geodetic control
    network, underlying the datum, was executed or initiated. An old
    datum can remain valid after a new datum is defined. Alternatively,
    a datum may be superseded by a later datum, in which case the
    realization epoch for the new datum defines the upper limit for the
    validity of the superseded datum.
